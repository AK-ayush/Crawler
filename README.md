##Overview
The best way to extract data that is spread out across many pages of a site is by building a Crawler. Based on your training, a Crawler travel to every page of that site looking for other pages that match. Crawlers are best used for when you want lots of data, but donâ€™t know all the URLs for that site. A web crawler can systematically extract data from multiple webpages for you. It does so by crawling, or accessing, webpages and returns the data you need for each one of them.
